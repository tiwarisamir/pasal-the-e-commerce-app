# Pasal

Pasal is a sophisticated e-commerce application designed for a seamless shopping experience, built with a powerful tech stack. The frontend leverages React and TypeScript for a dynamic and type-safe interface, styled with SASS for maintainability. Redux ensures efficient state management across the app. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust server-side framework. Firebase handles authentication, ensuring secure and reliable user access, while Mongoose, paired with MongoDB, manages the database operations for flexible and scalable data storage. For media management, Cloudinary offers optimized and high-quality image delivery, making Pasal a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform.
